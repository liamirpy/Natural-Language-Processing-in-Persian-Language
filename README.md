############
Hi guys 
This is my first repository and I'm so excited about this because now I can present my skills and share it.
This repository is about applying NLP to farsi language.

Natural language processing (NLP):
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.(for more detail:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)

As it's abovious when your documents getting huge its become impossible to reading all the ducuments and extracting importants details, so we trying to find a way to do all this in efficient way in short time.


In this project I'm trying to expressing most importants method that would be useful in language processing, BUT in Persian Language.

The methods are:
. Text Classification
. Sentimet Analysis
. Valance Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (VADER)
. Topic Modeling
. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)


I will explain each of them in more detail in other sequences repository.

All the methods were coded in python.

If you are new to python and NLP this Progect is NOT for you.
